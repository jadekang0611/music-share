# Music PlayList App For My Family

I like YouTube because I can easily listen to music or watch K-Pop music videos, but I don't want my little kids to use YouTube because there are too many inappropriate contents that just pop up out of nowhere. I also don't like the fact that Google tracks what I do on YouTube. Therefore, I decided to develop a simple music playlist application where my wife and I can easily add any songs that we enjoy listening to with our lovely kids.

# About The Project

There are many ways to use GraphQL and React, however I thought there are only few efficient and best ways to use them as a senior frontend engineer. Therefore, I decided to study and practice ApolloGraphQL and Asura along with GraphQL and React to build a music playlist application.
